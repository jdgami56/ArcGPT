# ArcGPT - Cloud Architecture Diagram Generator

## Overview
ArcGPT is an AI-powered tool that simplifies cloud architecture visualization. By leveraging **Diagrams**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI**, it enables users to describe their cloud infrastructure in natural language and automatically generate corresponding architecture diagrams. This tool is designed for cloud architects, DevOps engineers, and developers to streamline architecture documentation and visualization.

## Installation Guide (Windows)
Follow these steps to install the required dependencies and set up ArcGPT on your Windows machine.

### **1. Install Python**
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. If not, download and install it from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
